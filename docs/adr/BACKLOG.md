# ADR backlog

Work deliberately punted out of an accepted or proposed ADR, kept here so it resurfaces at the
next `/adr-write` instead of dying in a scope section. `adr-debt docs/adr` sweeps the `(deferred:)`
pointers that lead here.

An entry leaves this file in one of two ways: it becomes an ADR, or it is re-tagged
`(permanent: <why>)` in its originating ADR because we decided it should never happen.

## From ADR-001 (recall answers or abstains)

- **Contradiction reporting** — recall says "this changed on `<date>`: it was X, it is now Y".
  Blocked on a populated temporal knowledge graph: the palace holds ~65 triples against ~5,020
  drawers, so the mechanism exists and is unfed. Revisit once `kg-extract` has run at corpus scale.
- **Write-time findability gate** — when a memory is filed, generate the question it answers and
  try to retrieve it; report at write time when a memory is unfindable at birth. Reuses ADR-001's
  calibration, so it is drafted after ADR-001 ships rather than beside it.
- **Continuous evaluation with automatic promotion** — shadow-run competing retrieval
  configurations against real traffic and promote the winner when a paired test clears. Blocked on
  real-query telemetry volume: `search_events` currently holds ~10 rows, which is why the
  `--style real` eval arm produced n=4.
- **Learned multi-feature abstention** — a classifier over score, margin, distance and lexical
  coverage rather than one threshold. Blocked on labels: 21 verified-absent cases cannot fit and
  hold out. Revisit above ~200, and only if it beats the one-float-per-backend baseline on the same
  risk–coverage curve.
- **Growing the verified-absent corpus** beyond what a single `--n` run produces, including whether
  hard negatives can be mined from real queries instead of generated.
- **Reading recorded verdicts back for production calibration** — ADR-001 records the verdict in
  `search_events`; nothing consumes it yet. That consumption is the same loop as continuous
  evaluation above and should land with it.
