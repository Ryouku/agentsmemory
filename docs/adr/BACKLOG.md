# ADR backlog

Work deliberately punted out of an accepted or proposed ADR, kept here so it resurfaces at the
next `/adr-write` instead of dying in a scope section. `adr-debt docs/adr` sweeps the `(deferred:)`
pointers that lead here.

An entry leaves this file in one of two ways: it becomes an ADR, or it is re-tagged
`(permanent: <why>)` in its originating ADR because we decided it should never happen.

## From ADR-001 (recall answers or abstains)

- **Contradiction reporting** — recall says "this changed on `<date>`: it was X, it is now Y".
  Blocked on a populated temporal knowledge graph: measured 2026-08-18 on the pre-reset palace, ~65
  triples against ~5,020 drawers, so the mechanism existed and was unfed. Post-reset (2026-08-20)
  the ratio inverted — 41 triples against 80 drawers — so the blocker is now corpus size, not
  extraction coverage. Revisit once `kg-extract` has run at corpus scale.
- **Write-time findability gate** — when a memory is filed, generate the question it answers and
  try to retrieve it; report at write time when a memory is unfindable at birth. Reuses ADR-001's
  calibration, so it is drafted after ADR-001 ships rather than beside it.
- **Continuous evaluation with automatic promotion** — shadow-run competing retrieval
  configurations against real traffic and promote the winner when a paired test clears. Blocked on
  real-query telemetry volume: `search_events` held ~10 rows on the pre-reset palace, which is why
  the `--style real` eval arm produced n=4; it holds 25 as of 2026-08-20.
- **Learned multi-feature abstention** — a classifier over score, margin, distance and lexical
  coverage rather than one threshold. Blocked on labels: the 21 verified-absent cases the pre-reset corpus
  produced cannot fit and hold out. Revisit above ~200, and only if it beats the one-float-per-backend baseline on the same
  risk–coverage curve.
- **Growing the verified-absent corpus** beyond what a single `--n` run produces, including whether
  hard negatives can be mined from real queries instead of generated.
- **Reading recorded verdicts back for production calibration** — ADR-001 records the verdict in
  `search_events`; nothing consumes it yet. That consumption is the same loop as continuous
  evaluation above and should land with it.

## Standing: the instrument is not allowed to decide the hypothesis space

The eval scores ranked lists by MRR, which is IR's framing — retrieve documents, rank them, score
the rank. That framing has already acted as a filter on what we consider worth building: an idea
was counted DOWN in a design review for being "unmeasurable by an eval that scores ranked lists",
which is the instrument choosing the experiments rather than the other way round.

It is also why a published "raw chunked storage beats summarisation" result read as a verdict on
consolidation when it is a recall result — and raw text is a superset of any summary of it, so a
superset cannot lose that metric. We built our measuring stick from the same tradition whose limits
we are trying to get past.

The rule is therefore NOT "measure before you default" — that one earns its keep every week. It is:
**when a claim does not fit the instrument, extend the instrument.** Never read "we cannot measure
it" as "it is not worth building"; read it as a gap in the harness.

Metrics the harness still cannot express, each blocking a class of idea:

- **Answer-support / tokens-to-answer** — a metric a superset cannot automatically win, which is
  the precondition for evaluating any consolidation or compression idea honestly.
- **Findability-at-write** — whether a memory can be retrieved by the question it answers, measured
  when it is filed rather than in an eval weeks later.
- **Retrieval-conditioned value** — which memories actually get used, from `search_events`, so
  consolidation can be driven by what is ASKED FOR rather than by what was written. No published
  memory benchmark can express this: a benchmark runs once and has no usage history. We are a
  service and do.
- **Non-ranking outcomes generally** — abstention quality (in progress, ADR-001) and supersession
  correctness (in progress, ADR-004) are the first two; they should not be the last.

## Candidate pool should be a measured ceiling, not a constant

`DefaultRerankPool = 50`, `DefaultSearchLimit = 5`, `MaxSearchLimit = 100` and
`hybridCandidateMultiplier = 3` are the same numbers on a 5,000-drawer palace and on one
orders of magnitude larger. The retrieval reach they buy is not the same:

Measured 2026-08-18, before the reset:

- large corpus, `--pool 50`: 3 of 30 answers outside the pool (~10% unreachable)
- large corpus, `--pool 128`: 1 of 30 (~3%)
- our corpus then (45x smaller, ~5,020 drawers), `--pool 20`: 1 of 40 (~2.5%)

A small palace reaches ~97% of its answers with a pool of 20; the large one needs ~128 for the
same reach. One constant is wrong for one of them by roughly a factor of six.

Three quantities are currently conflated under one idea of a "limit", and they scale differently:

- **candidate pool** — bounds what is reachable at all; should scale with corpus.
- **rerank pool** — bounded by cross-encoder inference cost, which is linear in pool size, NOT by
  corpus. Scaling it with the corpus makes latency scale with the corpus, which is the thing a
  vector index exists to avoid.
- **page returned to the agent** — bounded by the consumer's context budget. Should NOT scale with
  corpus at all: more results from a bigger palace is more to be wrong about.

The proposal is deliberately not `pool = f(N)`, which would be a new inherited constant with an
exponent bolted on. It is a **target retrieval ceiling** — declare that some share of answers must
be in the pool, and let the pool be whatever achieves it on this corpus, measured by the retrieval
ceiling the eval now reports. Same cure as `max_distance`, the BM25 normaliser and `rerankWeight`:
replace a number somebody typed once with an operating point somebody measured.

Note the coupling before changing either: when the candidate pool exceeds the rerank pool, fusion
decides which candidates the cross-encoder ever sees. Growing one without the other silently hands
more of the decision to the weaker signal.

## The product is a runtime quality control plane, not an eval score

Forty generated cases are a release guardrail. They caught real wiring defects this week — a dead
eval arm, chunk-level gold, a production arm measuring a limit nobody uses — and they cannot
establish production quality, because the thing that degrades in production is not the ranking
function. It is everything around it as the index, the traffic, the tenants and the models change.

What `search_events` records today: wing, room, query, candidate count, hit count, top score,
whether a reranker was configured, and a timestamp. That answers almost none of the questions a
running memory service has to answer:

- is the index fresh and complete, and what fraction is pending embedding?
- is candidate recall degrading as the corpus grows? (measurable without labels — see below)
- which stages actually ran, which failed OPEN, which were bypassed?
- what are the embed / vector-search / rerank / total latencies, per stage?
- are the score, margin and no-answer distributions drifting?
- which tenant, backend, ranking profile, index size and model version produced this behaviour?

Three primitives unlock all of it, in dependency order.

**1. Profile identity on every event.** A `profile_id` covering candidate-pool configuration,
fusion mode, lexical normaliser and weight, closet scale, rerank model/backend/blend, and index
version. Without it no drift signal is interpretable and no calibration can state what it is valid
for — an abstention threshold should say "valid for profile X", never "valid for TEI".

**2. Stage outcomes, so failing open is visible.** Every stage records ran / bypassed / failed-open
with its latency. Reranking currently falls back to the fused order on error and says so only in a
log line — the exact defect class that shipped an inert reranker in a release and printed a full
table of "reranked" numbers that were the hybrid order.

**3. Implicit relevance feedback — the one that scales.** Return a `search_id` with every recall
and accept it on `am_get_drawer`. Then an agent fetching a memory in full after a search is a
click; an immediate reformulation is a miss; abandonment is a miss. Web search has run on this
signal for twenty-five years. No agent-memory benchmark can produce it, because a benchmark has no
users — and it is the only source of relevance judgement that grows with usage instead of with our
labelling budget. It also measures the thing that actually matters: whether agents keep using
recall because it earns its place in their context.

Pool-recall degradation is measurable without labels too. If the cross-encoder frequently promotes
a candidate from deep in the fused order, the pool boundary is binding and should grow; if it never
promotes below rank ten, the pool is oversized and is being paid for in latency. That is a
self-tuning signal for the candidate pool, from production traffic, with no gold anywhere.

The loop the product actually needs is serve → observe → detect drift → shadow alternatives →
canary → promote or roll back. Offline eval sits inside that loop; it does not own it.

And "every capability exercised" should not mean equal traffic — `am_status` should outrank
`am_delete_wing` by orders of magnitude. It should mean every enabled component proves it ran,
exposes its cost and its effect, and can be turned off when it adds neither.

## Unused core capabilities — what the palace offers and nobody calls

Audited 2026-08-20 against a live palace of 80 drawers across 8 wings, one day after a full reset.
The drawer count moves by tens per day while sessions refile, so read it as a snapshot; the zeros
below were re-confirmed against the same palace at 80 drawers.
The server registers 41 tools; roughly eight are in regular use. What is built, working, and idle:

| capability | live count | why it is idle |
|---|---|---|
| closets | **0** | Built by `am_mine` only, and mining is retired for now — the prior it feeds measured harmful on mined corpora (~0.10 MRR) and `CLOSET_BOOST` defaults to 0. The summary index itself is untested against a curated corpus, which is a different question from the ranking prior and has never been asked. |
| hallways | **0**, and structurally so | Not "nobody ran the build step" — `am_recompute_graph` was run across all 8 wings on 2026-08-20 and returned `hallways: 0, entity_tunnels: 0`. Hallways are entity co-occurrence, and 82 of 82 drawers have an empty `entities` column: `Service.Add` (`internal/palace/service.go:305`) builds its `Drawer` literal without one, and the only code that ever calls `extractEntities` is `internal/palace/mine.go`. Mining is retired, so nothing writes the input. |
| tunnels | **0** | Explicit tunnels have never been created by a session, and derived ones cannot exist: `entityTunnelsForWing` (`internal/palace/tunnel.go:180`) takes hallways as its input, so it inherits the zero above. The craft/project wing split is exactly what explicit tunnels are for, and that half is available today. |
| skills (centralised) | 2 | Was **0** for the project's whole life: every session reported `am_list_skills` empty and fell back to generic conventions while the bootstrap called loading them a hard gate, so the gate passed vacuously. `memory-orchestration` and `writing-memories` were published 2026-08-20 and sessions began loading them the same hour. `effective-go` and `cqrs` — the two this repo's protocol names by name — were published the same day, so the catalogue holds 4 and the promise in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` is true for the first time. |
| anchors | 5 | Used, and the cross-repo verdict bug that deleted memories is fixed. Adoption is still incidental rather than routine. |
| knowledge graph | 41 triples | Genuinely in use by sessions since the reset, but its job is undecided — ADR-004 exists to make supersession its acceptance criterion rather than recall. |
| `am_merge_wing` | first use 2026-08-20 | Folded two derived wings into one after registrations corrected. Worked exactly as documented; simply nobody had needed it before. |

Three of these are worth acting on, in order:

1. **Make the catalogue reachable on a fresh install.** The four skills exist in *this* palace
   because they were pushed by hand. A fresh `aiagentmemory install` seeds no skills at all, so
   `AGENTS.md`'s claim that `effective-go` lives in the centralised catalogue is true here and false
   everywhere else — the reachability defect one level up: the capability is finished and nothing
   selects it for a new workspace. `update-skill` is not this; it refreshes local markdown. What is
   missing is a seed path (skill bodies in the repo tree, pushed at install) plus the gate that
   naturally follows: a test failing when the protocol names a skill the tree does not carry.

2. **Decide the entity graph: feed it or retire it.** This is the repository's own named defect,
   and the largest instance of it yet. Hallways, derived entity tunnels and the entity half of
   `am_traverse` are written, tested and reachable by tool call — three MCP tools and a rebuild
   command — and all of them return nothing, because their single input is written by one retired
   code path. `am_mine` calls `extractEntities`; `Service.Add` does not, so every drawer filed by
   `am_add_drawer` or `am_diary_write` carries an empty `entities` column, 82 of 82 today. The tests
   pass because they exercise the component (given entities, compute hallways) rather than the
   selection (does anything ever produce entities), which is the same shape as the eval arm that
   won four tables while being unreachable from production.

   Two honest options, and the measurement should pick between them. **Feed it:** call the existing
   entity extractor on the normal write path, so hallways and derived tunnels describe the curated
   corpus rather than a mined one — cheap, since `closetEntities` already exists and runs on
   content we already hold. **Retire it:** delete the hallway/entity-tunnel derivation and the two
   tools that expose it, and keep explicit tunnels only. What is not an option is leaving three
   tools in a catalogue of 41 that answer every call with an empty list, because an agent reading
   the catalogue cannot tell that apart from a palace that simply has no links yet.

   Whichever way it goes needs a gate that fails when the input dries up again — a test asserting
   that a drawer written through the normal path carries entities, which fails today and is
   therefore the right red test to open the ADR with.

3. **Use explicit tunnels for the craft/project split.** Independent of the entity graph above and
   available now: a craft lesson learned in a project incident should carry a tunnel back to the
   incident that taught it, so a rule that gets challenged can be traced to its evidence. The
   protocol tells agents tunnels exist and never says when to weave one, which is why the count is
   zero on the explicit side too.
